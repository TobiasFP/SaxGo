# SaxGo

A go wrapper for the Saxo open api

This wrapper does not include the OAuth/OpenID flow. You will need to provide your own http client, logged in with
proper credentials. Furthermore, it is meant to be a wrapper for easy use that does not look to provide much
flexibility (Only trade on one accountkey ,etc.)
